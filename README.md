# Stats220
## Project 1

This is my *updated* repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in physics
- I am taking STATS 220 because it's interesting to see how we make data useful and I need this course
- I am interested in learning about all the coding stuff we'll use 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
